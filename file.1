Part 1: Short Answer Questions (30 points)
1. Problem Definition (6 points)
AI Problem: Predicting student dropout rates in secondary schools.
Objectives:
‚Ä¢	Identify at-risk students early.
‚Ä¢	Allocate targeted interventions.
‚Ä¢	Improve overall graduation rates.
Stakeholders:
‚Ä¢	School administrators
‚Ä¢	Students and parents
KPI: Reduction in actual dropout rate over a school year.
2. Data Collection & Preprocessing (8 points)
Data Sources:
‚Ä¢	Student attendance records
‚Ä¢	Academic performance reports
Potential Bias: Students from low-income backgrounds might be overrepresented in dropout cases, skewing the model.
Preprocessing Steps:
‚Ä¢	Impute missing attendance values
‚Ä¢	Normalize grades to a common scale
‚Ä¢	Encode categorical variables like gender and school location
3. Model Development (8 points)
Model: Random Forest
Justification: Robust against overfitting, handles both numerical and categorical data well.
Data Split:
‚Ä¢	70% Training
‚Ä¢	15% Validation
‚Ä¢	15% Test
Hyperparameters:
‚Ä¢	Number of trees (affects complexity and accuracy)
‚Ä¢	Max depth (controls overfitting)
4. Evaluation & Deployment (8 points)
Metrics:
‚Ä¢	Precision (to reduce false positives in identifying dropouts)
‚Ä¢	Recall (to ensure high detection of at-risk students)
Concept Drift: Occurs when data patterns change over time (e.g., pandemic affecting attendance).
Monitoring: Retrain model periodically and compare performance on new data.
Deployment Challenge: Scalability across diverse school systems with different data formats.
üè• Part 2: Case Study Application (40 points)
Problem Scope (5 points)
Problem: Predicting 30-day patient readmission risk.
Objectives:
‚Ä¢	Reduce preventable readmissions
‚Ä¢	Improve resource planning
Stakeholders:
‚Ä¢	Hospital administrators
‚Ä¢	Medical staff
Data Strategy (10 points)
Sources:
‚Ä¢	Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
‚Ä¢	Patient demographics and lifestyle data
Ethical Concerns:
‚Ä¢	Patient privacy
‚Ä¢	Data consent and usage transparency
Preprocessing Pipeline:
‚Ä¢	Handle missing values (e.g., medication history)
‚Ä¢	Normalize lab test results
‚Ä¢	Feature engineering: time since last admission, number of prior visits
Model Development (10 points)
Model: Logistic Regression
Justification: Interpretability is critical in healthcare decisions.
Confusion Matrix Example:
	Predicted: Readmit	Predicted: No Readmit
Actual: Readmit	80	20
Actual: No Readmit	30	70
‚Ä¢	Precision: 80 / (80 + 30) = 0.727
‚Ä¢	Recall: 80 / (80 + 20) = 0.800
Deployment (10 points)
Integration Steps:
‚Ä¢	API connection to hospital EHR system
‚Ä¢	Staff training and dashboard design
Regulatory Compliance:
‚Ä¢	Encrypt data and follow HIPAA standards
‚Ä¢	Perform regular audits and implement access controls
Optimization (5 points)
Method: Use regularization (L2) and cross-validation to prevent overfitting.
üß© Part 3: Critical Thinking (20 points)
Ethics & Bias (10 points)
Impact of Bias:
Underrepresented populations may be misclassified, leading to unequal care.
Mitigation Strategy:
Use balanced datasets and fairness-aware algorithms.
Trade-offs (10 points)
Interpretability vs Accuracy:
Neural networks offer higher accuracy but less interpretability, which may undermine trust in clinical settings.
Limited Resources Impact:
Choose simpler models (e.g., Decision Trees) and optimize for speed and efficiency.
üí¨ Part 4: Reflection & Workflow Diagram (10 points)
Reflection (5 points)
Most Challenging: Ensuring ethical fairness in data and model decisions.
Improvement: Collaborate with domain experts and expand data collection for better representativeness.
